# Longest Palindromic Subsequence

A ***palindrome*** is a sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, e.g., "level", "noon","racecar". 
Given a sequence $A$ of $n$ characters, your task is to compute the ***length*** of the **longest palindromic subsequence** of $A$, i.e., the *length* of the *longest subsequence* of $A$ that is a *palindrome*.
For instance, if $A$ is "ETZHEEHU", "HEEH" is the longest palindromic subsequence of $A$, and its length is **4**.


**Grading** (16 points):

- An $O(n^2)$-time implementation gets 16 points, while an $O(2^n)$-time implementation still gets 6 points.


**Note**: The input array $A$ is indexed from $0$, and all characters are capitals. 


**Attention**: 

- You are NOT allowed to use imports explicitly or implicitly other than the imports already in the code template.  
- You see the **percentage** of your submission in the CodeExpert system instead of points.
